    While route recommendation plays a vital role in digital tourism services, conventional methods tend to be inherently complex, as they need to consider several constraints at once: user preferences, geographical and scheduling information, etc. Besides, recent interests from society and institutions have motivated a greater emphasis on sustainability across multiple sectors, including tourism. This work proposes to use reranking techniques as a plain and efficient method to generate personalized routes for users while considering sustainable goals in the procedure. We believe that these results could lead to new research directions regarding sustainable route recommendation techniques.

      This article is a summary of the work published in the journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery. It presents an analysis of different types of biases and polarization measurements that affect the area of Point-Of-Interest recommendation. Our results evidence which state-of-the-art recommenders suffer from (venue or category) popularity bias, venue exposure polarization, and geographical distance polarization. We also propose a mitigation procedure to reduce these biases in the recommendations while maintaining a good performance in terms of relevance.

    The involvement of geographic information differentiates point-of-interest recommendation from traditional product recommendation. This geographic influence is usually manifested in the effect of users tending toward visiting nearby locations, but further mobility patterns can be used to model different groups of users. In this study, we characterize the check-in behavior of local and traveling users in a global Foursquare check-in data set. Based on the features that capture the mobility and preferences of the users, we obtain representative groups of travelers and locals through an independent cluster analysis. Interestingly, for locals, the mobility features analyzed in this work seem to aggravate the cluster quality, whereas these signals are fundamental in defining the traveler clusters. To measure the effect of such a cluster analysis when categorizing users, we compare the performance of a set of recommendation algorithms, first on all users together, and then on each user group separately in terms of ranking accuracy, novelty, and diversity. Our results on the Foursquare data set of 139,270 users in five cities show that locals, despite being the most numerous groups of users, tend to obtain lower values than the travelers in terms of ranking accuracy while these locals also seem to receive more novel and diverse POI recommendations. For travelers, we observe the advantages of popularity-based recommendation algorithms in terms of ranking accuracy, by recommending venues related to transportation and large commercial establishments. However, there are huge differences in the respective travelers groups, especially between predominantly domestic and international travelers. Due to the large influence of mobility on the recommendations, this article underlines the importance of analyzing user groups differently when making and evaluating personalized point-of-interest recommendations.

    Users from Location-Based Social Networks can be characterised by how and where they move. However, most of the works that exploit this type of information neglect either its sequential or its geographical properties. In this article, we focus on a specific family of recommender systems, those based on nearest neighbours; we define related users based on common check-ins and similar trajectories and analyse their effects on the recommendations. For this purpose, we use a real-world dataset and compare the performance on different dimensions against several state-of-the-art algorithms. The results show that better neighbours could be discovered with these approaches if we want to promote novel and diverse recommendations.

    Research in Recommender Systems evaluation remains critical to study the efficiency of developed algorithms. Even if different aspects have been addressed and some of its shortcomings - such as biases, robustness, or cold start - have been analyzed and solutions or guidelines have been proposed, there are still some gaps that need to be further investigated. At the same time, the increasing amount of data collected by most recommender systems allows to gather valuable information from users and items which is being neglected by classical offline evaluation metrics. In this work, we integrate such information into the evaluation process in two complementary ways: on the one hand, we aggregate any evaluation metric according to the groups defined by the user attributes, and, on the other hand, we exploit item attributes to consider some recommended items as surrogates of those interacted by the user, with a proper penalization. Our results evidence that this novel evaluation methodology allows to capture different nuances of the algorithms performance, inherent biases in the data, and even fairness of the recommendations.

    The use of contextual information like geographic, temporal (including sequential), and item features in Recommender Systems has favored their development in several different domains such as music, news, or tourism, together with new ways of evaluating the generated suggestions. This paper presents the underlying research in a PhD thesis introducing some of the fundamental considerations of the current tourism-based models, emphasizing the Point-Of-Interest (POI) problem, while proposing solutions using some of these additional contexts to analyze how the recommendations are made and how to enrich them. At the same time, we also intend to redefine some of the traditional evaluation metrics using contextual information to take into consideration other complementary aspects beyond item relevance. Our preliminary results show that there is a noticeable popularity bias in the POI recommendation domain that has not been studied in detail so far; moreover, the use of contextual information (such as temporal or geographical) help us both to improve the performance of recommenders and to get better insights of the quality of provided suggestions.

    Typically, performance of recommender systems has been measured focusing on the amount of relevant items recommended to the users. However, this perspective provides an incomplete view of an algorithm's quality, since it neglects the amount of negative recommendations by equating the unknown and negatively interacted items when computing ranking-based evaluation metrics. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework where anti-relevance is seamlessly introduced in several ranking-based metrics; in this way, we obtain a different perspective on how recommenders behave and the type of suggestions they make. Based on our results, we observe that non-personalized approaches tend to return less bad recommendations than personalized ones, however the amount of unknown recommendations is also larger, which explains why the latter tend to suggest more relevant items. Our metrics based on anti-relevance also show the potential to discriminate between algorithms whose performance is very similar in terms of relevance.

    The main goal of a Recommender System is to suggest relevant items to users, although other utility dimensions -- such as diversity, novelty, confidence, possibility of providing explanations -- are often considered. In this work, we study two dimensions that have been neglected so far in the literature: coverage and temporal novelty. On the one hand, we present a family of metrics that combine precision and coverage in a principled manner (correctness); on the other hand, we provide a measure to account for how much a system is promoting fresh items in its recommendations (freshness). Empirical results show the usefulness of these new metrics to capture more nuances of the recommendation quality.

    Neighbourhood-based approaches, although they are one of the most popular strategies in the recommender systems area, continue using classic similarities that leave aside the sequential information of the users interactions. In this extended abstract, we summarise the main contributions of our previous work where we proposed to use the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm as a similarity measure between users, by adapting it to the recommender systems context and proposing a mechanism to transform users interactions into sequences. Furthermore, we also introduced some modifications on the original LCS algorithm to allow non-exact matchings between users and to bound the similarities obtained in the [0,1] interval. Our reported results showed that our LCS-based similarity was able to outperform different state-of-the-art recommenders in two datasets in both ranking and novelty and diversity metrics.

    Time-aware recommender systems is an active research area where the temporal dimension is considered to improve the effectiveness of the recommendations. Even though performance evaluation is dominated by accuracy-related metrics – such as precision or NDCG –, other properties of the recommended items like their novelty and diversity have attracted attention in recent years, where several metrics have been defined with this goal in mind. However, it is unclear how suitable these metrics are to measure novelty or diversity in temporal contexts. In this paper, we propose a formulation to capture the time-aware novelty (or freshness) of the recommendation lists, according to different time models of the items. Hence, we provide a measure to account for how much a system is promoting fresh items in its recommendations. We show that time-aware recommenders tend to provide more fresh items, although this is not always the case, depending on statistical biases and patterns inherent to the data. Our results, nonetheless, indicate that the proposed formulation can be used to extend the knowledge about what items are being suggested by any recommendation technique aiming to exploit temporal contexts.

    Recommender systems is an active research area where the major focus has been on how to improve the quality of generated recommendations, but less attention has been paid on how to do it in an efficient way. This aspect is increasingly important because the information to be considered by recommender systems is growing exponentially. In this paper we study how different data structures affect the performance of these systems. Our results with two public datasets provide relevant insights regarding the optimal data structures in terms of memory and time usages. Specifically, we show that classical data structures like Binary Search Trees and Red-Black Trees can beat more complex and popular alternatives like Hash Tables.
