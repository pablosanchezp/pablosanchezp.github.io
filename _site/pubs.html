        	<span><b>Abstract: </b> "Suggesting new venues to be visited by a user in a specific city remains an interesting but challenging problem, partly because of the inherent high sparsity of the data available in location-based social networks (LSBNs). At the same time, in traditional recommender systems, in order to improve their performance in these sparse situations, different techniques have been proposed mainly by augmenting and aggregating the data available in different domains. In this paper, we address the problem of venue recommendation from a novel perspective: we propose two strategies to select a set of candidate cities in order to use their information when performing recommendations for the users in a specific (target) city. In this context, we categorize users into two different groups (tourists and locals) according to their movement patterns and analyze the potential biases in the recommendations received by each of these groups. We provide an experimental comparison of several recommendation algorithms in a temporal split, where we analyze two strategies to select cities and augment the available data: based on the number of interactions and based on the distance with respect to the target city. Our results show that, in general, extending the available data by proximity increases the performance of the majority of the tested recommenders in terms of relevance and coverage, with almost no change in novelty and diversity. We have found that those users belonging to the tourist group tend to obtain better results in terms of relevance. Furthermore, in general, tourists consistently exhibit different performance by some families of recommenders for other evaluation dimensions, evidencing a popularity bias in user behavior and raising potential fairness issues regarding the quality of the received recommendations. We investigate these aspects and provide methods to better understand the problem. We expect these results could provide readers with an overall picture of what can be achieved in a real-world environment."

        	<span><b>Abstract: </b> "Venue recommendation approaches have become particularly useful nowadays due to the increasing number of users registered in location-based social networks (LBSNs), applications where it is possible to share the venues someone has visited and establish connections with other users in the system. Besides, the venue recommendation problem has certain characteristics that differ from traditional recommendation, and it can also benefit from other contextual aspects to not only recommend independent venues, but complete routes or venue sequences of related locations. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the problem of route recommendation under the perspective of generating a sequence of meaningful locations for the users, by analyzing both their personal interests and the intrinsic relationships between the venues. We divide this problem into three stages, proposing general solutions to each case: First, we state a general methodology to derive user routes from LBSNs datasets that can be applied in as many scenarios as possible; second, we define a reranking framework that generate sequences of items from recommendation lists using different techniques; and third, we propose an evaluation metric that captures both accuracy and sequentiality at the same time. We report our experiments on several LBSNs datasets and by means of different recommendation quality metrics and algorithms. As a result, we have found that classical recommender systems are comparable to specifically tailored algorithms for this task, although exploiting the temporal dimension, in general, helps on improving the performance of these techniques; additionally, the proposed reranking strategies show promising results in terms of finding a trade-off between relevance, sequentiality, and distance, essential dimensions in both venue and route" recommendation tasks..

        	<span><b>Abstract: </b> Modeling user profiles is a necessary step for most information filtering systems - such as recommender systems - to provide personalized recommendations. However, most of them work with users or items as vectors, by applying different types of mathematical operations between them and neglecting sequential or content-based information. Hence, in this paper we study how to propose an adaptive mechanism to obtain user sequences using different sources of information, allowing the generation of hybrid recommendations as a seamless, transparent technique from the system viewpoint. As a proof of concept, we develop the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm as a similarity metric to compare the user sequences, where, in the process of adapting this algorithm to recommendation, we include different parameters to control the efficiency by reducing the information used in the algorithm (preference filter), to decide when a neighbor is considered useful enough to be included in the process (confidence filter), to identify whether two interactions are equivalent (δ-matching threshold), and to normalize the length of the LCS in a bounded interval (normalization functions). These parameters can be extended to work with any type of sequential algorithm. We evaluate our approach with several state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms using different evaluation metrics measuring the accuracy, diversity, and novelty of the recommendations, and analyze the impact of the proposed parameters. We have found that our approach offers a competitive performance, outperforming content, collaborative, and hybrid baselines, and producing positive results when either content- or rating-based information is exploited.

        	<span><b>Abstract: </b> Neighbourhood-based techniques, although very popular in recommendation systems, show different performance results depending on the specific parameters being used; besides the neighbourhood size, a critical component of these recommenders is the similarity metric. Therefore, by considering more information associated to the users – such as taking into account the ordering of the items as they were consumed or the whole interaction pattern between users and items – it should be possible to define more complete, and better performing, similarity metrics for collaborative filtering. In this paper, we propose a technique to compare users – also extendable to items –, working with them as sequences instead of vectors, hence enabling a new perspective to analyse the user behaviour by finding other users who have similar sequential patterns instead of focusing only on similar ratings in the items. We also compare our approach with other well-known techniques, showing comparable or better performance in terms of rating prediction, ranking evaluation, and novelty and diversity metrics. According to the results obtained, we believe there is still a lot of room for improvement, due to its generality and the good performance obtained by this technique.

However, most of the works that exploit this type of information neglect either its sequential or its geographical properties. In this article, we focus on a specific family of recommender systems, those based on nearest neighbours; we define related users based on common check-ins and similar trajectories and analyse their effects on the recommendations. For this purpose, we use a real-world dataset and compare the performance on different dimensions against several state-of-the-art algorithms. The results show that better neighbours could be discovered with these approaches if we want to promote novel and diverse recommendations.

        	<span><b>Abstract: </b> Research in Recommender Systems evaluation remains critical to study the efficiency of developed algorithms. Even if different aspects have been addressed and some of its shortcomings - such as biases, robustness, or cold start - have been analyzed and solutions or guidelines have been proposed, there are still some gaps that need to be further investigated. At the same time, the increasing amount of data collected by most recommender systems allows to gather valuable information from users and items which is being neglected by classical offline evaluation metrics. In this work, we integrate such information into the evaluation process in two complementary ways: on the one hand, we aggregate any evaluation metric according to the groups defined by the user attributes, and, on the other hand, we exploit item attributes to consider some recommended items as surrogates of those interacted by the user, with a proper penalization. Our results evidence that this novel evaluation methodology allows to capture different nuances of the algorithms performance, inherent biases in the data, and even fairness of the recommendations.

        	<span><b>Abstract: </b> The use of contextual information like geographic, temporal (including sequential), and item features in Recommender Systems has favored their development in several different domains such as music, news, or tourism, together with new ways of evaluating the generated suggestions. This paper presents the underlying research in a PhD thesis introducing some of the fundamental considerations of the current tourism-based models, emphasizing the Point-Of-Interest (POI) problem, while proposing solutions using some of these additional contexts to analyze how the recommendations are made and how to enrich them. At the same time, we also intend to redefine some of the traditional evaluation metrics using contextual information to take into consideration other complementary aspects beyond item relevance. Our preliminary results show that there is a noticeable popularity bias in the POI recommendation domain that has not been studied in detail so far; moreover, the use of contextual information (such as temporal or geographical) help us both to improve the performance of recommenders and to get better insights of the quality of provided suggestions.

        	<span><b>Abstract: </b> Typically, performance of recommender systems has been measured focusing on the amount of relevant items recommended to the users. However, this perspective provides an incomplete view of an algorithm's quality, since it neglects the amount of negative recommendations by equating the unknown and negatively interacted items when computing ranking-based evaluation metrics. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework where anti-relevance is seamlessly introduced in several ranking-based metrics; in this way, we obtain a different perspective on how recommenders behave and the type of suggestions they make. Based on our results, we observe that non-personalized approaches tend to return less bad recommendations than personalized ones, however the amount of unknown recommendations is also larger, which explains why the latter tend to suggest more relevant items. Our metrics based on anti-relevance also show the potential to discriminate between algorithms whose performance is very similar in terms of relevance.

In this work, we study two dimensions that have been neglected so far in the literature: coverage and temporal novelty. On the one hand, we present a family of metrics that combine precision and coverage in a principled manner (correctness); on the other hand, we provide a measure to account for how much a system is promoting fresh items in its recommendations (freshness).

In this extended abstract, we summarise the main contributions of our previous work where we proposed to use the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm as a similarity measure between users, by adapting it to the recommender systems context and proposing a mechanism to transform users interactions into sequences. Furthermore, we also introduced some modifications on the original LCS algorithm to allow non-exact matchings between users and to bound the similarities obtained in the [0,1] interval. Our reported results showed that our LCS-based similarity was able to outperform different state-of-the-art recommenders in two datasets in both ranking and novelty and diversity metrics.

        	<span><b>Abstract: </b> Time-aware recommender systems is an active research area where the temporal dimension is considered to improve the effectiveness of the recommendations. Even though performance evaluation is dominated by accuracy-related metrics – such as precision or NDCG –, other properties of the recommended items like their novelty and diversity have attracted attention in recent years, where several metrics have been defined with this goal in mind. However, it is unclear how suitable these metrics are to measure novelty or diversity in temporal contexts. In this paper, we propose a formulation to capture the time-aware novelty (or freshness) of the recommendation lists, according to different time models of the items. Hence, we provide a measure to account for how much a system is promoting fresh items in its recommendations. We show that time-aware recommenders tend to provide more fresh items, although this is not always the case, depending on statistical biases and patterns inherent to the data. Our results, nonetheless, indicate that the proposed formulation can be used to extend the knowledge about what items are being suggested by any recommendation technique aiming to exploit temporal contexts.

This aspect is increasingly important because the information to be considered by recommender systems is growing exponentially. In this paper we study how different data structures affect the performance of these systems. Our results with two public datasets provide relevant insights regarding the optimal data structures in terms of memory and time usages. Specifically, we show that classical data structures like Binary Search Trees and Red-Black Trees can beat more complex and popular alternatives like Hash Tables.

        	<span><b>Abstract: </b> Finding the next venue to be visited by a user in a specific cityis an interesting, but challenging, problem. Different techniqueshave been proposed, combining collaborative, content, social, andgeographical signals; however it is not trivial to decide which tech-nique works best, since this may depend on the data density or theamount of activity logged for each user or item. At the same time,cross-domain strategies have been exploited in the recommendersystems literature when dealing with (very) sparse situations, suchas those inherently arising when recommendations are producedbased on information from a single city.In this paper, we address the problem of venue recommendationfrom a novel perspective: applying cross-domain recommenda-tion techniques considering each city as a different domain. Weperform an experimental comparison of several recommendationtechniques in a temporal split under two conditions: single-domain(only information from the target city is considered) and cross-domain (information from many other cities is incorporated intothe recommendation algorithm). For the latter, we have exploredtwo strategies to transfer knowledge from one domain to another:testing the target city and training a model with information of thekcities with more ratings or only using thekclosest cities.Our results show that, in general, applying cross-domain byproximity increases the performance of the majority of the recom-menders in terms of relevance. This is the first work, to the bestof our knowledge, where so many domains (eight) are combinedin the tourism context where a temporal split is used, and thus weexpect these results could provide readers with an overall pictureof what can be achieved in a real-world environment.

        	<span><b>Abstract: </b> Recommender systems are widely used tools in a large number ofonline applications due to their ability to learn the tastes and needsof the users. Venue recommendation approaches have recently be-come particularly useful, and even though these techniques havecertain characteristics that differ from traditional recommendation,they deserve special attention from the research community due tothe increase on the number of applications using tourism informa-tion to perform venue suggestions. In particular, how to properlyevaluate (in an offline setting) this type of recommenders needsto be better analyzed, as they are normally evaluated using stan-dard evaluation methodologies, neglecting their unique features. Inthis paper, we discuss and propose some solutions to two specificaspects around this problem: how to deal with already interactedvenues in the test set and how to incorporate the sequence of vis-ited venues by the user when measuring the performance of analgorithm (i.e., in an evaluation metric).

        	<span><b>Abstract: </b> Modelling the temporal context efficiently and effectively is essen-tial to provide useful recommendations to users. Methods suchas matrix factorisation and Markov chains have been combinedrecently to model the temporal preferences of users in a sequentialbasis. In this work, we focus on Neighbourhood-based Collabo-rative Filtering and propose a simple technique that incorporatesinteraction sequences when producing a personalised ranking. Weshow the efficiency of this method when compared against othersequence- and time-aware recommendation methods under twoclassical temporal evaluation methodologies.
